Title: Reviewing Robust Location and Scatter Estimators

Abstract: We build statistical models to describe real phenomena based on theoretical assumptions. These assumptions are often approximations of the reality, hence holding true only for the most part of the data but not all. Any data not following them ends up jeopardizing our effort to perform statistical inference. Robust inference builds methods that are resistant to these violations of assumptions. On the other hand, current real-life data are often high dimensional, hence it is necessary to build robust statistical methods for multivariate data. In this talk, we are going to review some of the existing robust locations and scatter estimators for multivariate data and talk about their motivations, origins, and describe their major properties. We shall also compare these methods in the light of different robustness metrics like influence function, breakdown points, etc, and with the help of a real-life dataset.
